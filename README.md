**Cyber Wars Game Overview**

Cyber Wars is an innovative, cybersecurity-themed card game designed to simulate real-world cyber-attack and defense scenarios. It is an engaging educational tool that immerses players in the strategic complexities of cybersecurity, allowing them to experience both offensive and defensive roles. The game supports Continuous Professional Development (CPD) by helping players develop critical cybersecurity skills in a dynamic, risk-free environment.

**How It Works:**

**Game Setup:**

Players choose between two teams: the Red Team (threat actors) or the Blue Team (cyber defenders).
Each team starts with a predefined amount of startup capital and reputation points, which are used to purchase initial assets such as security tools or attack capabilities.
The game progresses through a series of turns, each composed of four distinct phases: Asset Phase, Attack Phase, Mitigation Phase, and Contract Phase.

**Gameplay Phases:**

**Asset Phase:**

Both teams can buy or sell assets to enhance their attack or defense strategies.
Red Team purchases offensive tools (e.g., OSINT tools, C2 servers) while the Blue Team invests in defensive measures (e.g., firewalls, SOC analysts).

**Attack Phase:**

The Red Team decides whether to launch an attack and, if so, which assets to deploy.
Attacks can range from Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) to advanced persistent threats (APTs), depending on the assets acquired.

**Mitigation Phase:**

The Blue Team counters the Red Team's attacks using their defensive assets.
If the Blue Team fails to mitigate an attack, they suffer losses in capital and reputation, simulating the real-world impact of a cyber breach.

**Contract Phase:**

The Blue Team can secure business contracts if they possess the necessary defense assets.
Securing contracts enhances the Blue Team's capital and reputation, providing resources for further asset acquisition.

**Winning the Game:**

**Single Player Mode:**

The Blue Team wins by building a complete Security Operations Center (SOC) or loses if their capital or reputation drops to zero.

**Two Player Mode:**

Victory can be achieved in two ways:

By accumulating the most money and reputation after a set number of rounds.
By either the Red Team reducing the Blue Team's capital or reputation to zero, or the Blue Team fully developing its defenses to repel all attacks.

**What It Teaches:**

Cyber Wars provides players with a hands-on, interactive way to understand and apply cybersecurity principles. It teaches the intricacies of both cyber offense and defense, offering insights into the strategies employed by real-world attackers and defenders. By playing the game, participants develop a deeper understanding of the following:

Cyber Defense Strategies: Learn how to build and manage a comprehensive defense posture, including the use of firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and Security Operations Centers (SOCs).

Cyber Attack Techniques: Gain insights into the tools and methodologies used by attackers, such as social engineering, DDoS attacks, and more sophisticated, persistent threats.

Risk Management: Understand the importance of balancing resources between securing your organization and maintaining operational effectiveness.

Business Continuity Planning: Learn how to ensure your organisation's survival and success by securing business contracts and maintaining reputation, even in the face of ongoing cyber threats.

**Key Learning Objectives:**

Cyber Wars is not just a game; it is a practical learning tool designed to foster critical cybersecurity skills. The key learning objectives include:

Developing Strategic Thinking:

Players learn to think as both attackers and defenders, anticipating the opponent's moves and countering them effectively.
This dual perspective enhances strategic planning skills, crucial for cybersecurity professionals tasked with defending against sophisticated threats.

Enhancing Risk Assessment Abilities:

The game teaches players how to evaluate and prioritise risks, focusing on the most critical threats while managing limited resources.
This is vital for roles in cybersecurity that require constant vigilance and the ability to make quick, informed decisions.

Strengthening Incident Response Skills:

Through the Mitigation Phase, players practice responding to cyber incidents, honing their ability by deploy defenses and minimise damage.
This experience translates to improved real-world incident response capabilities, a key competency for cybersecurity teams.

Building Knowledge of Cybersecurity Tools and Techniques:

As players purchase and deploy assets, they gain familiarity with a wide range of cybersecurity tools and techniques.
This knowledge is directly applicable to professional settings, where understanding the capabilities and limitations of different technologies is essential.

Improving Resource Management:

Players must manage their capital and reputation carefully, investing in the right assets at the right time to maximise their defensive capabilities.
This skill is critical for cybersecurity professionals responsible for budget allocation and resource prioritization in real-world scenarios.

Promoting Team Collaboration and Communication:

In Group-player mode, teamwork and communication are key to coordinating attacks and defenses effectively.
These collaborative skills are essential in professional cybersecurity environments, where teams must work together seamlessly to protect organizational assets.

**CPD-Based Skills Development:**

Cyber Wars is designed to support Continuous Professional Development (CPD) by fostering the following critical skills:

Cyber Threat Intelligence: By playing as the Red Team, participants enhance their understanding of threat actor tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), which is essential for roles in threat intelligence and adversarial emulation. Whilst playing as the Blue Team an astute player is able to attempt to predict the Red Teams attacks based upon what assets and attacks they have played, and in doing so develop their cyber resilience accordingly.

Incident Handling and Response: The game’s structure mirrors real-world incident response processes, helping players improve their ability to react swiftly and effectively to cyber incidents.

Strategic Resource Allocation: The need to manage and allocate resources in the game simulates real-world budget and resource management challenges faced by cybersecurity professionals.

Risk Mitigation and Compliance: Players learn how to implement effective risk mitigation strategies, ensuring that their defensive posture complies with industry standards and best practices.

Cyber Wars is more than just a game; it's a sophisticated training tool that equips players with the knowledge and skills required to excel in the fast-paced world of cybersecurity. Through strategic gameplay, participants not only enjoy a competitive experience but also build a solid foundation in cyber defense, attack strategies, and resource management—key competencies for any cybersecurity professional.
